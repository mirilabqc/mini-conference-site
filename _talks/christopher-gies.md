  For Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC), we discuss the relationship between the reservoirâ€™s performance for quantum machine learning (QML) and its physical properties in terms of the optical absorption. We also address expressivity measures in QRC: in establishing a link between gate-based QML and QRC, we show that the role of the reservoir itself is of little impact for its capability to produce non-linear output functions of a given input. For currently suggested input-encoding schemes, no exponential advantage of the quantum system can be exploited, posing the general question of quantum advantage in QML.
