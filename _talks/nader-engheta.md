## Abstract

In recent years, there has been growing interest and extensive research activities in exploring specially designed metamaterials and metasurfaces for optical analog computing. In my group, we have been exploring various scenarios for such light-based computing and have introduced and developed methodologies for vector-matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, equation solving, and constrained optimization using such metastructures. In this talk, I will present an overview of some of our most recent results from our ongoing research programs in my group. Salient features and physical insights into our findings will be presented, and possible future research directions will be forecasted.
