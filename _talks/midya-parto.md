  Over the past few decades, photonics has played a crucial role in applications ranging from long-haul ultrafast telecommunications to optical sensing and spectroscopy. The sheer volume of the data generated from the widespread implementation of such technologies is rapidly growing to levels where the conventional computing hardware architectures are failing to catch up. The emerging field of optical computing aims to effectively harness the high bandwidths offered by light for faster and more efficient information processing. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work on leveraging ultrafast and efficient nonlinear photonic processes to perform high-speed optical processing using a variety of platforms.
