## Abstract

Optimization is vital to Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and to many areas of Science. Mathematically, we usually employ steepest-descent, or other digital algorithms. But every inequality in Physics performs optimization in the normal course of dynamical evolutionâ€”for free. In effect, Physics can provide machines which solve digital optimization problems much faster than any conventional computer.
