## Abstract

In this talk I will discuss the use of exciton-polaritons, light-matter hybrid quasiparticles for computing. Specifically, we will discuss the use of polariton condensates formed in organic molecular systems to realize optically and lithographically imprinted lattices. Their implementation for reservoir computing at room temperature will also be presented. I will conclude with a brief discussion on the use of these condensates for realizing coherent polaritonic circuits.
