  Engineered nonlocal responses in metasurfaces have recently unveiled a paradigm for image processing and analog-based computing. Several demonstrations performing edge-detection and image-processing using tailored spatial nonlocality have shown a path towards ultrafast, efficient, massively parallel analog image processing based on passive devices, which holds the promise for general analog computing platforms. Space-time nonlocal metasurfaces performing space- and time-operations on the incoming signal have also been envisioned by tailoring frequency and momentum dispersions. In this talk, I discuss opportunities for this research field, showcasing compact meta-structures with reconfigurable properties that can perform mathematical operations, solve mathematical problems and address technological needs.
