## Abstract

We introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems.
